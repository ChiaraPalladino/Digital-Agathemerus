This table provides a prospectus of all the distance estimates found in Agathemerus. 
The text is largely based on my transcription of Vatopedi 655 (Lond. Add. 19391 and Par. Suppl. Gr. 443A), the variants are from Diller's edition (Diller, Aubrey. “Agathemerus, Sketch of Geography.” Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 16, no. 1 (1975): 59–76; http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/view/8681), the text of the Excerpta J is taken from from Kotter's edition of the "Expositio Fidei Orthodoxae" by John of Damascus (Kotter, Bonifatius. Die Schriften Des Johannes von Damaskos 2. Vol. 12. Patristische Texte Und Studien. Berlin [u.a.], 1973). 

The table is largely a work-in-progress, and represents some evidence aimed at systematizing linguistic expressions of distances in the Geographi Graeci Minores and Roman Itineraries.
