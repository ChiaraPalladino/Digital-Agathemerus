The following folders contain the cleaned transcriptions of all the manuscripts and print editions of the Digital Agathemerus. They have been used in the iAligner interface to perform dynamic visualizations of the variants occurring throughout the tradition, and can be investigated at http://ialigner.com/Agathemerus.   

## The groups: 

The folders contain the several groups aligned in the iAligner interface. The individual transcriptions of each witness can be accessed from the single folders. 

* **Group 1** investigates the relations between the ancient tradition of Agathemerus and the early apographs, copied in the house of Francesco D'Asola in Venice after 1545. 
* **Group 2** provides an alignment between the various D'Asola manuscripts and c7, a witness of second generation belonging to the same family. 
* **Group 3** investigates the relations between the ancient tradition and another group of early apographs, belonged to the library of the Ambassador Diego Hurtado the Mendoza in the second half of the 16th century. 
* **Group 4** aligns the second generation of copies from the Mendoza manuscripts.
* **Group 5** provides the alignment between an early manuscript edition, written by Isaac Vossius, and its probable antigraphs. 
* **Group 6**, **Group 7** and **Group 8** align other early manuscript editions and their probable antigraphs. They are the edition of Lucas Holstenius, Ismael Bullialdus and Emmanuel Miller respectively.
* **Group 9** provides a quick alignment of the early print tradition, from the first edition conceived for print (wendelin_gr) to the last authoritative edition, Karl Müller's _Geographi Graeci Minores_. 
* **Group 10** investigates the relations between the oldest ms. of Agathemerus (B) and the indirect tradition. 

## Sigla Codicum:
Note: ancient or early Humanistic manuscripts are indicated with a letter, as usual. Manuscript editions by well-known Humanists are indicated with their name, e.g. **Vossius** indicates the manuscript edition of Agathemerus by the hand of Isaac Vossius, found in the Vossianus Gr. In-Octavo 7. In order to distinguish manuscript from print editions, the latter are indicated with the conventional filename, e.g. **müller_gr** refers to the Greek text of K. Müller, in _Geographi Graeci Minores_, Vol. II (Paris: Didot 1861). The only exception to this rule is **wendelin_gr** which refers to a manuscript edition, but has a more significant relation with the print tradition. 

Fragmentary manuscripts do not have, at present, a _siglum_, and therefore are indicated with a conventional filename referring to their shelfmark.

# Notes on the transcription:

The transcription has been performed in accordance with the CTS and EpiDoc standards (on which you can read more [here](http://cts.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/Canonical_Text_Service.html), [here](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/cts-urn-overview.html), and [here](http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/)).

The transcription that we used here is diplomatic, but we have pre-processed the text in order to delete the punctuation and non-essential decorations, to ensure minimum noise in the performance of the alignment. However, you can always perform your own version of the alignment, by taking into account punctuation, using the complete diplomatic transcription that will be soon available at the [Digital Agathemerus Repository](http://chiarapalladino.github.io/Digital-Agathemerus/).   

The transcription of the **excerpta J** is the only document that preserves a somehow artificial text. It does not derive directly from a manuscript, but it is a slightly modified version of the text of John Damascene, as printed in the critical edition by Bonifaz Kotter (Berlin 1973). The reason for this is that the tradition of these excerpts is homogenic in the related manuscripts.
