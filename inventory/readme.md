### Inventory of Graeco-Roman geographical texts in machine readable format 
#### 7th cent. BC to 4th cent. CE 

This inventory contains texts of geographical interest pertaining to the Graeco-Roman world. The texts are selected according to their availability in a machine-readable format (txt or xml). 

Definitions of the inventory: 

- Texts are in Greek or Latin. Translations are not included. 

- "Real" geographical space is privileged. Texts pertaining to imaginary, paradoxographic or mythological geographies, such as Homer, Apollonius Rhodius and the Paradoxographi Graeci, are not included. 

- Chronology: 7th-4th century. A second part of this inventory will be devoted to texts from the V century onwards, including a larger part of the Geographi Latini Minores. 

- Links bring to .txt or .xml versions in downloadable format. Complete texts are also available in the Perseus GitHub repository. The links to Pelagios bring to downloadable XML TEI versions: however, it is necessary to register to Recogito in order to use them. 

- Some texts are added, which can be copypasted directly from the given link. Pdf, scans and images are not included. 

### Notes

Although I am aware that "geographical" is far from being a precise definition of a genre, it is my intention to initially focus on textual instances where the density of geographical data (including number of places and descriptions) is predominant in the entire work. Therefore, I am not including works which are of large interest for the geography of the ancient world, such as Caesar's Gallic Wars and Sallust's Bellum Iugurthinum, because the proportion of their geographical material is comparatively low. However, it is my goal to add them in a further stage of the project.   
  
The catalog is being continuously updated. Additions and corrections are welcome.
