### Inventory of Graeco-Roman geographical texts in machine-readable format 
#### 7th cent. BC to 4th cent. CE 

This inventory contains texts of geographical interest pertaining to the Graeco-Roman world. The texts are selected according to their availability in machine-readable format (txt or xml). 

Criteria: 

- Texts are in Greek or Latin. Translations are not included: the majority of these texts, however, has translations available in the same repository. 

- "Real" geographical space is privileged. Texts pertaining to imaginary, paradoxographic or mythological geographies, such as Homer, Apollonius Rhodius and the Paradoxographi Graeci, are not included. 

- Chronological span: 7th-4th century. A second stage will be devoted to texts from the 5th century onwards, including a larger part of the Geographi Latini Minores. 

- Formats: .txt or .xml, exceptions are indicated in the table (mainly texts that can be copypasted but are not directly downloadable). Complete texts in raw .xml format are also available in the Perseus GitHub repository. The links to Pelagios bring to downloadable XML TEI documents: however, it is necessary to register to Recogito in order to use them. 

- Pdf, scans and images are not included. 

- I am considering ONLY texts in the Public Domain or under various CC conditions. I am not considering any text provided under subscription or subject to other usage restrictions aside from Creative Commons.  

### Notes

Although I am aware that "geographical" is far from being a precise definition of a genre, it is my intention to initially focus on textual instances where the density of geographical data (including number of places and descriptions) is predominant in the entire work. Therefore, I am not including works which are of large interest for the geography of the ancient world, such as Caesar's Gallic Wars and Sallust's Bellum Iugurthinum, because the proportion of their geographical material is comparatively low. However, it is my goal to add them, with further specification of their geographical data, in a further stage of the project.
