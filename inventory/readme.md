### Inventory of Graeco-Roman geographical texts in machine-readable format 
#### 7th cent. BC to 6th cent. CE 

### Important remarks

* This inventory contains texts of geographical interest pertaining to the Graeco-Roman world. The texts are selected according to their availability in machine-readable format (txt or xml), or any other easily accessible textual format (e.g. from html resources, csv or any other tabular format database). 

* This is NOT a catalog of digital editions of geographical texts. Its purpose is to indicate texts whose available online format is suitable for further study, e.g. geotagging or spatial modelling. 

* Although I am aware that "geographical" is far from being a precise definition of a genre, it is my intention to initially focus on textual instances where the density of geographical data (including number of places and descriptions) is predominant in the entire work. Therefore, I am not including works which are of large interest for the geography of the ancient world, such as Caesar's Gallic Wars and Sallust's Bellum Iugurthinum, because the proportion of their geographical material is comparatively low. However, it is my goal to add them, with further specification of their geographical data, in a further stage of the project.   

* I am considering ONLY texts in the Public Domain or under various CC conditions. I am not considering any text provided under subscription or subject to other usage restrictions aside from Creative Commons (TLG, Loeb).
  
* The catalog is being continuously updated. Additions and corrections are welcome. 

### Criteria 

- Language: texts are in Greek or Latin. Translations are not included: most of them, however, have translations available in the same repository. 

- "Real" geographical space is privileged. Texts pertaining to imaginary, paradoxographic or mythological geographies, such as Homer, Apollonius Rhodius and the Paradoxographi Graeci, are not included. 

- Chronological span: 7th BC- end of the 5th century CE. A second stage will be devoted to texts from the 6th century onwards, including a larger part of the Geographi Latini Minores. 

- Formats: .txt or .xml, exceptions are indicated in the table (mainly texts that can be copypasted but are not directly downloadable). Complete texts in raw .xml format are also available in the Perseus GitHub repository. 

- Maps are going to be included if compliant with the specified time-span. 

- Editions: I am including essential bibliographical references to editions in use, and free of Copyright issues wherever possible. 

- Edition identifiers: Most of the textual sources are currently cataloged and provided with unique URN identifiers within the Perseus Catalog (http://catalog.perseus.org/). Where possible, URN identifiers for the specific editions are indicated; where such editions are not cataloged, the URN for the author or the work is provided. Epigraphic and Papyrological sources, on the other hand, are almost totally cataloged in Trismegistos (http://www.trismegistos.org/), where the are provided with individual, unique and stable records in URL form. The database is aligned with all mostly used databases of Epigraphic and Papyrological sources (Eagle, APIS, Mertens-Pack, etc.) through LDAB. 

### Updates

The links bringing to Recogito v. 1 have been deprecated, and replaced with new repositories wherever possible. 
Ongoing editorial work that is likely to be completed within this and the next year is also included.
